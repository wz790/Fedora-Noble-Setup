# ✨ My Fedora Linux Noble Setup Guide (Post-Installation)

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/assets/logo.png" alt="Fedora Setup Logo - Nord Style" width="250"/>
</p>

Hey there! So you just installed Fedora and now you're staring at a fresh desktop wondering "what next?" I've been there, and honestly, setting up a new Linux install can feel overwhelming. That's why I put together this guide - it's basically everything I wish someone had told me when I first switched to Fedora.

This isn't some corporate documentation. It's just me sharing what actually works, what breaks, and how to fix it when things go sideways (because they will, and that's totally normal).

**Who's this for?**
- Brand new to Fedora? Perfect.
- Coming from Ubuntu or another distro? Also perfect.
- Been using Fedora for years but want a solid checklist? Yep, you too.
- Complete Linux newbie? You might struggle a bit, but stick with it!

**Quick heads up about commands:**
- When you see `sudo` at the start, that means "run as admin" - it'll ask for your password
- The `-y` flag just means "yes to everything" so you don't have to keep pressing enter
- Copy-paste is your friend, but always read what you're about to run first

## 🔥 First Things First

### RPM Fusion - The Good Stuff

Okay, first thing - Fedora ships pretty bare-bones because of legal reasons. RPM Fusion is where all the actually useful stuff lives (codecs, drivers, etc.). You want this.

```bash
# Get the free repository (most stuff you need)
sudo dnf install -y \
  https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

# Get the nonfree repository (NVIDIA drivers, some codecs)
sudo dnf install -y \
  https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

# Update everything so it all plays nice together
sudo dnf group upgrade core -y
sudo dnf check-update
```

### Updates (Boring but Important)

Yeah, I know, updates are boring. But seriously, do this first. Fresh installs always have outdated packages.

```bash
# Update everything
sudo dnf update -y

# If it updated the kernel, reboot
sudo reboot
```

### Firmware Updates

Your hardware probably has newer firmware available. This actually matters for things like WiFi and battery life.

```bash
# See what can be updated
sudo fwupdmgr get-devices

# Refresh the firmware database
sudo fwupdmgr refresh --force

# Check for updates
sudo fwupdmgr get-updates

# Apply them
sudo fwupdmgr update
```

Some firmware updates need a reboot. Just do it.

### Give Your Computer a Name

This is purely cosmetic but makes you feel more at home. Pick something fun!

```bash
# Replace with whatever you want
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname hungry-beast
```

## 📦 Getting More Software

### [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) Setup

Fedora comes with a neutered version of Flatpak. Flathub is where the actual apps are.

```bash
# Remove the limited Fedora repo
flatpak remote-delete fedora

# Add the real Flathub
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# Update everything
flatpak update --appstream
```

### [Terra](https://terra.fyralabs.com/) Repository (If You're Feeling Adventurous Like Finn and Jacke)

> [!Caution]
> ⚠️ Add it only if you know what you're doing (At your own Risk)

Terra has some community packages that aren't in the main repos. It's optional but sometimes useful.

```bash
#Add Terra Repository 
sudo dnf install -y --nogpgcheck --repofrompath 'terra,https://repos.fyralabs.com/terra$releasever' terra-release
```

## 🎮 Graphics Drivers

### NVIDIA (The Tricky One)

NVIDIA on Linux is... complicated. This works most of the time, but if you have issues, welcome to the club.

**Before you start:**
- Turn off Secure Boot in your BIOS (or learn to sign kernel modules – your choice)
- Make sure everything is updated and rebooted

```bash
# Update and reboot first
# Install kernel headers and dev tools
sudo dnf install -y kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc make dkms acpid libglvnd-glx libglvnd-opengl libglvnd-devel pkgconfig

# Enable RPM Fusion (if not already)
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

> [!NOTE]
> Special Note for RTX 4000 and Newer Series:
> If you're using a 4000 or 5000 series GPU (e.g. 4060, 4080, 5090), Fedora needs a build macro set before installing the driver. This enables the open kernel module.


```bash
# Set open kernel module macro (one-time step)
sudo sh -c 'echo "%_with_kmod_nvidia_open 1" > /etc/rpm/macros.nvidia-kmod'
```

Install the NVIDIA driver:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y akmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda
```

**Now wait.** Seriously. It takes 5–15 minutes to build the module.

You can monitor progress with:
```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u akmods
```

Once done:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

Check if it worked:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

---

**If it doesn't work:**

```bash
# Force rebuild and try again
sudo akmods --force --kernels $(uname -r)
sudo reboot
```
> [!NOTE]
> - **Secure Boot:** The NVIDIA module isn't signed by default. Either disable Secure Boot or manually sign the module.
> - **5000 Series (May 2025):** Fedora 42's live installer lacks proper Nouveau support for 5000 series GPUs. You might get stuck in 800×600 resolution during install, which can break the UI.
> - **Manual rebuilds:** After kernel updates, especially on newer GPUs, you might need to run:
  ```bash
  sudo akmods --kernels $(uname -r) --rebuild
  sudo reboot
  ````

If you're stuck in 800×600, a black screen, or land in a terminal (tty) instead of your desktop, the NVIDIA module probably didn't build correctly. Use an older kernel from GRUB > Advanced Options and rerun the rebuild commands.


### AMD & Intel (The Easy Ones)

These usually just work, but let's make them work better.

**Both AMD & Intel:**
```bash
# Basic drivers and Vulkan support
sudo dnf install -y mesa-dri-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-loader mesa-libGLU
```

**AMD:**
```bash
# AMD video acceleration (makes videos smoother)
sudo dnf install -y mesa-va-drivers-freeworld mesa-vdpau-drivers-freeworld
```

**Newer Intel GPUs:**
```bash
# Intel video acceleration (for newer Intel GPUs)
sudo dnf install -y intel-media-driver
```
**Older Intel GPUs:**
```bash
# Intel video acceleration (for Grandfather Intel GPUs)
sudo dnf install libva-intel-driver
```

## 🎵 Making Media Work

### Video Codecs (So Everything Plays)

Fedora ships with basically no codecs because of patent issues. This fixes that.

```bash
# Replace the neutered ffmpeg with the real one
sudo dnf swap -y ffmpeg-free ffmpeg --allowerasing

# Install all the GStreamer plugins
sudo dnf install -y gstreamer1-plugins-{bad-\*,good-\*,base} gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 gstreamer1-libav lame\* --exclude=gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-devel

# Install multimedia groups

sudo dnf4 group install multimedia
sudo dnf group install -y sound-and-video
```

### Hardware Acceleration

This makes video playback use your GPU instead of hammering your CPU.

```bash
# Install VA-API stuff
sudo dnf install -y ffmpeg-libs libva libva-utils
```
```bash
# If you have NVIDIA, add this too
sudo dnf install -y nvidia-vaapi-driver
```

### Firefox Video Fix

Firefox needs a little help with H.264 videos.

```bash
# Install the Cisco codec (it's free but weird licensing)
sudo dnf install -y openh264 gstreamer1-plugin-openh264 mozilla-openh264

# Enable the Cisco repo
sudo dnf config-manager setopt fedora-cisco-openh264.enabled=1
sudo dnf update -y
```

Restart Firefox and check that the OpenH264 plugin is enabled in `about:addons`.

## 🔧 Useful Stuff

### Archive Support

Because you'll definitely need to extract a .rar file someday.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y p7zip p7zip-plugins unrar
```

### Microsoft Fonts (Unfortunately Still Needed)

Web pages and documents still look weird without these.

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo dnf install -y curl cabextract xorg-x11-font-utils fontconfig

# Install the fonts
sudo rpm -i https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-installer-2.6-1.noarch.rpm

# Update font cache
sudo fc-cache -fv
```

### AppImage Support

Some apps only come as AppImages. This makes them work.

```bash
# Install FUSE
sudo dnf install -y fuse fuse-libs

# Optional: AppImage manager (actually pretty useful)
flatpak install -y flathub it.mijorus.gearlever
```

### Flatpak Auto-Updates

You can keep your Flatpak apps up to date automatically. This setup updates your Flatpaks every 24 hours and especially helpful if you disable GNOME Software on startup.
```bash
# Create the service unit
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/flatpak-update.service > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Update Flatpak apps automatically

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/flatpak update -y --noninteractive
EOF

# Create the timer unit
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/flatpak-update.timer > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Run Flatpak update every 24 hours
Wants=network-online.target
Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Timer]
OnBootSec=120
OnUnitActiveSec=24h

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOF

# Reload systemd and enable the timer
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now flatpak-update.timer

# Check the status to verify everything is working
sudo systemctl status flatpak-update.timer
```

## ⚡ Making Things Faster

### Faster Boots

This one's easy and makes a noticeable difference.

```bash
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```

### Better Battery Life

Fedora's power management is pretty good, but I personally prefer [TLP](https://github.com/linrunner/TLP) For my Laptop:

> [!Caution]
> ⚠️ don’t mess with this unless you know what you're doing my Frindo ;) 

```bash
#Add TLP Repository 
sudo dnf install https://repo.linrunner.de/fedora/tlp/repos/releases/tlp-release.fc$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

# Install TLP
sudo dnf install tlp tlp-rdw

#Remove conflicting power profile demone
sudo dnf remove tuned tuned-ppd

# Enable TLP service 
sudo systemctl enable tlp.service

#Mask the following services to avoid conflicts with TLP’s Radio Device Switching options
sudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service systemd-rfkill.socket

```
Only install TLP if Fedora's built-in power management isn't working for you.


### Dual Boot Time Fix

If you dual boot with Windows, this fixes the clock being wrong.

```bash
# Tell Fedora to use UTC for hardware clock
sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 0 --adjust-system-clock
```

### Performance Tweaks (Proceed with Caution)

> [!Caution]
> ⚠️ This disables important security features. Only do this if you know what you're doing and only if you're really desperate for a bit more speed in older CPUs. On modern CPUs, you won't notice any difference anyway so don't risk with it.

```bash
# To disable CPU mitigations (NOT recommended)
# sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="mitigations=off"

# To re-enable them later (DO THIS)
# sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="mitigations=off"
```

## 🔒 Security Stuff

### Encrypted DNS (Optional but Cool)

This encrypts your DNS queries so your ISP can't see what websites you're visiting.

First add the cloudflared repository and install it with:
```bash
#Add Cloudflared repository
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared.repo

# Install cloudflared
sudo dnf install -y cloudflared
```
Then do The rest:
```bash
# Create a systemd service for cloudflared
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cloudflared.service > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Cloudflared DNS-over-HTTPS proxy
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cloudflared proxy-dns --upstream https://1.1.1.1/dns-query --upstream https://1.0.0.1/dns-query
Restart=on-failure
User=nobody
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Reload and enable the service
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now cloudflared

# Configure systemd-resolved to use 127.0.0.1 (cloudflared)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns-over-https.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1
FallbackDNS=1.1.1.1
DNSSEC=yes
Cache=yes
EOF

# Tell NetworkManager to use systemd-resolved
sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[main]
dns=systemd-resolved
EOF

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

# Test DNS resolution
dig +short example.com

# Check current DNS status
resolvectl status
```

## 💾 Backup Your Stuff

### System Snapshots

If you're using Btrfs (default in newer Fedora), you can take snapshots with [btrfs assistant](https://gitlab.com/btrfs-assistant/btrfs-assistant).

```bash
sudo dnf install -y btrfs-assistant btrbk snapper
```

Setup:
1. Run `btrfs-assistant` to set up snapshots with a GUI
2. Enable automatic snapshots:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now snapper-timeline.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now snapper-cleanup.timer
```

**Important:** This only backs up system files, not your personal stuff unless you configure it differently.

### Personal Files

Use [Déjà Dup](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/deja-dup) for your documents, photos, etc.

```bash
# Install it
sudo dnf install -y deja-dup

# Or get it from Flathub
flatpak install -y flathub org.gnome.DejaDup
```

**Always backup to external storage or cloud, not the same disk.**

## 🎮 Gaming Setup

### Steam and Gaming

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) works great on Fedora thanks to Proton.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y steam
```

That's it. Seriously. Most Windows games just work now.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using an NVIDIA Newer GPU and Steam doesn't launch or acts weird, it's probably a missing dependency issue.
Just remove the RPM version and install the Flatpak one instead should work better and do a search how setup flatpak permissions if needed for some games or so...

```bash
#Removes Steam RPM version 
sudo dnf remove steam

#Install steam Flatpak version 
flatpak install flathub com.valvesoftware.Steam
```

## 🌟 Apps I Actually Use

### Browsers

**[Brave](https://brave.com/)** blocks ads, pretty fast:
```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://brave-browser-rpm-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser.repo
sudo dnf install brave-browser
```

**[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)** tons of customization options:
```bash
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=<(curl -s https://repo.vivaldi.com/archive/vivaldi-fedora.repo)
sudo rpm --import https://repo.vivaldi.com/archive/linux_signing_key.pub
sudo dnf install -y vivaldi-stable
```

### Development

**[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** basically spy software from the other world.VSCodium which is VS Code without the telemetry that's the one I'd recommend, but I still use regular VS Code anyway:
```bash
# Import Microsoft GPG key
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
# Add VS Code repository to system packages
sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo'
# Install VS Code
sudo dnf install -y code
```

**[JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)** Personally I use it for Rider and Android Studio,but you can find other JetBrains IDEs on it:
```bash
# Create temporary directory for download process
TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
# Fetch latest JetBrains Toolbox download URL from official site
ARCHIVE_URL=$(curl -s 'https://data.services.jetbrains.com/products/releases?code=TBA&latest=true&type=release' \
  | jq -r '.TBA[0].downloads.linux.link')
# Download the toolbox archive to temporary directory
curl -Lo "$TMP_DIR/toolbox.tar.gz" "$ARCHIVE_URL"
# Create installation directory in local share fold for JetBrains Toolbox
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox"
# Extract toolbox
tar -xzf "$TMP_DIR/toolbox.tar.gz" --strip-components=1 -C "$HOME/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox"
# Clean up temporary files we did for the installation
rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"
# Launch JetBrains Toolbox
"$HOME/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/jetbrains-toolbox" &
```

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** Mostly installed but let's confirm:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y git
```

**Containers**

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is better than Docker, fight me :):
```bash
#Podman core
sudo dnf install -y podman podman-compose podman-docker
#Podmman GUI
flatpak install flathub io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop
```

### Multimedia


**[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)** VLC is my go-to multimedia player, but it's totally up to you whether you use it or choose something else:
```bash
# Install VLC
sudo dnf install vlc
```

### Office Work

**[OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/)** better For MS Office compatibility:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y https://download.onlyoffice.com/install/desktop/editors/linux/onlyoffice-desktopeditors.x86_64.rpm
```

## 🖥️ Desktop Environment
### GNOME

**Stop GNOME Software autostart** This thing launches every boot and just sits there hogging memory. I always remove it:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/org.gnome.Software.desktop
```
**Note:** Removing GNOME Software from autostart disables update notifications (you'll need to open Software manually to check for updates) and stops automatic Flatpak updates. You'll need to update Flatpaks manually or use the auto-update methods mentioned above.

**Get GNOME Tweaks** You literally can't use GNOME without this. Need to add minimize/maximize buttons to Window? This is where you do it:

```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks
```

**Extra themes if you're into that** I stick with default but some people like options. Up to you:

```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-themes-extra
```

**Extension Manager is essential** Don't even think about skipping this one. Makes managing extensions actually easy:

```bash
flatpak install -y flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager
```

**Terminal Transparency** it's just better with it for me:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.Ptyxis.Profile:/org/gnome/Ptyxis/Profiles/$PTYXIS_PROFILE/ opacity .90
```

**My must-have extensions:** Its Just my personal preference do what you want :)

- [Vitals](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/) - shows CPU/RAM usage in top bar, pretty handy
- [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) - makes everything look less flat and boring
- [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) - turns the dock into something actually useful



### KDE
nothing for now XD


## 🧹 Keeping Things Clean

### Removing Bloat

> [!Caution]
> **Be careful here.** Only remove stuff you're sure you don't need.

```bash
# See what's installed
dnf list installed | less

# Check what depends on a package before removing it
dnf info package-name
dnf repoquery --whatrequires package-name

# Example removals (modify for your needs)
# sudo dnf remove -y cheese rhythmbox
```

### System Cleanup

Do this occasionally to free up space.

```bash
# Clean package cache
sudo dnf clean all

# Remove orphaned packages
sudo dnf autoremove -y

# Remove old kernels (if you have too many)
# sudo dnf remove $(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-3 -q)
```

---

## 👏 Thanks

This guide exists because a bunch of people before me figured this stuff out and shared it. Big thanks to folks like devangshekhawat, paulsorensen, Mohammed Besar, and countless others on forums and Reddit who've helped people get Fedora working properly.

*This isn't official Fedora documentation - it's just what works for me. Your mileage may vary. Always backup important stuff before making big changes, and don't blame me if something breaks (but feel free to ask for help on the Fedora forums).*

---

**Final note:** Linux can be frustrating sometimes, but it's also incredibly rewarding once you get it set up the way you like. Don't give up if something doesn't work the first time - that's just part of the experience!
